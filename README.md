# Quicksort

Implementation of quicksort which offers a choice of 3 different partitioning algorithms, and compares the performance of the 3 by counting the number of comparisons made. 

The 3 partitioning algorithms are:
- First element
- Last element
- Median of 3 (median of first, last, and middle element)

Run on a list of 10,000 elements, the 3 partitioning algorithms perform as follows

Partitioning Algorithm | Number of Comparisons |
--- | --- |
First Element | 162085 | 
Last Element | 164123 | 
Median of Three | 138382 |
